How to Enable WPA and WPA2 Enterprise (Wireless) on Raspberry Pi
The following requires your Raspberry Pi to be connected to a monitor, mouse, keyboard and internet.

In order to enable WPA & WPA2 Enterprise on a Raspberry Pi, follow the instruction below:

Open a terminal
Type: sudo apt install network-manager network-manager-gnome
Once the installation is finished, type: sudo raspi-config
In the configuration window select: 6 Advanced Options
Choose: AA Network Config
There are two options here: 1 dhcpcd and 2 NetworkManager
Select 2 NetworkManager
OK the action.
It may ask you to reboot the Pi. Ok that as well.
Once the reboot is done, you should be able to see SSU-SECURE as an option.
To configure it, follow the instructions on How to connect to ssu-secure wireless network in Ubuntu page.



How to connect to ssu-secure wireless network in Ubuntu
Here is the procedure:

Wi-Fi security: WPA & WPA2 Enterprise
Authentication: Protected EAP (PEAP)
Leave "Anonymous identity" and "Domain" blank
CA certificate: none
Leave "CA certificate password" blank
Check “No CA certificate is required” Box
PEAP version: Automatic
Inner authentication: MSCHAPv2
Now you should be able to sign in with your Seawolf Username and Password.



Disable dhcpcd: Since dhcpcd manages network connections by default on Raspberry Pi, you need to disable it to allow Network Manager to take control.

sudo systemctl disable dhcpcd
sudo systemctl stop dhcpcd

Enable Network Manager: Start and enable Network Manager to take over network management.

sudo systemctl enable NetworkManager
sudo systemctl start NetworkManager

sudo reboot

Check Network Manager Status: After rebooting, check if Network Manager is running correctly.

sudo systemctl status NetworkManager
