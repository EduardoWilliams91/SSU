Using a Raspberry Pi as a Bridge. (Router connected to Pi give WiFi)

sudo apt update
sudo apt full-upgrade
sudo apt-get install dhcpcd
sudo nano /etc/dhcpcd.conf

Add the following lines at the end to set up a static IP for the Ethernet interface (assuming the interface is eth0):

interface eth0
static ip_address=192.168.2.1/24
nohook wpa_supplicant

Save and close the file (Ctrl + X, then Y, then Enter).

Enable IP Forwarding:
Open the sysctl configuration file

sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf

Find or add the following line to enable IP forwarding:

net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

Save and close the file, then activate IP forwarding with

sudo sysctl -p

Configure NAT (Network Address Translation):
Set up NAT to allow internet sharing by running

sudo apt install iptables
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o wlan0 -j MASQUERADE

Check if the iptables rule for NAT is applied correctly:
Run the following to view iptables NAT table rules:

sudo iptables -t nat -L

You should see a rule like:

MASQUERADE  all  --  anywhere  anywhere

Make the iptables rules persistent across reboots:

sudo sh -c "iptables-save > /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat"

Add the following line to the /etc/rc.local file before the exit 0 line to load these rules on startup:

sudo iptables-restore < /etc/iptables.ipv4.nat

Configure the DHCP Server:
Install dnsmasq for DHCP and DNS services:

sudo apt-get install dnsmasq

Edit the configuration

sudo nano /etc/dnsmasq.conf

Add the following lines to configure the DHCP server on eth0:

interface=eth0
dhcp-range=192.168.2.50,192.168.2.150,12h
Restart the Raspberry Pi:

sudo reboot
